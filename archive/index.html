<p>This is the archive of all the old posts from my old Blogger blog. Considering that the first post was written in 2011, I decided that it would be best to archive all of the old content.</p>
<p>Much of what I previously posted was boring, and redundant information. I have shifted the focus of my blog to contain more original content and better writing.</p>
<p>You have been forewarned about the quality of the following content!</p>

  I apologize that I haven't written anything in a long time. I haven't forgotten, nor completely abandoned my blog. School and work have been my life for the last several months and I haven't had much time to work on anything else. I do plan on posting in the future and I'm also potentially looking to move to a .com domain at some point so that I'm hosting and running the entire blog myself.
  Stay tuned! Hopefully I'll post a couple times this summer and I'm hoping to post a bit more over the summer.

  </div>Apple announced an iPad mini that is as thin as pencil and weighs just over half a pound, as light as a pad of paper. It has a 7.9" display. Apple has made the iPad so that it has the same resolution as the 1024 x 768 iPad 2, so no extra work for developers. It sports a 720p FaceTime HD camera, a 5MP iSight camera, and a dual core A5 chip, as well as having LTE. And even though it's a smaller form factor, it still has a 10-hour battery life! It starts at $329 for a 16GB Wi-Fi only.

  </div>This morning, Apple announced an all-new 13" retina MacBook Pro. It is very similar to <a href="http://thegeektechblog.blogspot.com/2012/06/next-generation-macbook-pro-announced.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the 15" retina announced at WWDC</a>. The one downside that I see is that it isn't user-serviceable and it doesn't have an optical drive. Not that I want an optical drive, but I want to be able to put a second hard drive in the optical bay for a lot more space. As a video editor, I really need the extra space.

It's been awhile since I've written, since I've been busy, but there's news!! The rumors are confirmed; there <i>is</i> going to be an Apple event on October 23rd. Attendees began receiving invitations on Tuesday, according to <a href="http://www.imore.com/apple-sends-out-invitations-october-23-ipad-mini-event" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iMore</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/10/october-23-apple-confirmed-weve-got-a-little-more-to-show-you/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Arstechnica</a>. The tagline? "We've got a little more to show you." And interesting tagline, especially considering that all the rumors are pointing to the release of a smaller (little), 7.85" iPad. In addition, Apple is also rumored to refresh the iPad 3, with the new Lightning connector, as well as iMacs, Mac minis, 13-inch retina MacBook Pro, and the release of iTunes 11.<br />

      As you probably know, I am a member of the Stackexchange Q&amp;A network. There are a couple interesting chat bots in the chat rooms. The first is Eliza. You can find her user profile&nbsp;here.&nbsp;Eliza is actually an old chat bot that was ported to the Stackexchange chat room The Couch. It was one of the first chat bots programmed. She was written by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966. You can also find her in OS X's Terminal. If you type in 'emacs' at the prompt, then Shift + Esc, then x doctor then press Enter, you will be greeted...

      I've posted about Mozilla Prism before in this tutorial, but I wanted to come back and take a closer look at it. Mozilla Prism allows you to turn any webpage into an application on both Mac and PCs. Let's open it up and take a look. Here's the main window of Prism: As you can see, I've entered a URL (google.com) and a title (Google). Prism has auto-detected an icon for the application, but since it's so small, it will be really pixelated. Let's fix that first. I'm going to click Settings&gt;Choose image...

      Xray&nbsp;is a handy little Javascript tool for web developers. It allows you to "X-ray" any webpage so you can see positions, margins, padding, dimension, and extra details of any HTML element. The great thing about it that it costs...nothing! It's free! It's not even a download! All you need to do is drag this bookmark&nbsp;to your bookmarks bar. When you need it, you just click on the bookmark and you'll be presented with a nice little welcome screen: You can click on any element to X-ray it: All in all, it's a really great little tool.

      I was reading here&nbsp;about self-parking cars. Very cool technology! Though the car is not completely autonomous (it requires the driver to release the brake pedal while the computer controls the steering wheel), it makes the job of parallel parking easier. Six manufacturers, Ford, &nbsp;Lexus, Toyota, &nbsp;Mercury, Lincoln, and BMW offer self-parking cars. To park the car, the computer uses sensors on the bumpers to detect open parking spaces. Then, the car tells the driver what to do via a computer screen with instructions on when to brake, etc. The car can't yet completely park itself but...it's a start. The Lexus...

And no, you PC users can't use it. So, what can you do with AppleScripts? Well, open up AppleScript Editor (Script Editor on OS X systems before Snow Leopard 10.6).
